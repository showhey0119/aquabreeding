# Aquabreeding

The Aquabreeding software is a python tool for simulating aquatic breeding processes.

The Aquabreeding generates a founder population together with coalescent simulation implemented in [msprime](https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/stable/intro.html).  A progeny population is generated by crossing the founder individuals, and the progenies with larger breeding/phenotypic values are selected as the founder of the next generation.  Breeding values, variance components, and inbreeding coefficient are calculated in each step.

This is a beta version.  Please do not use it for any publications.
